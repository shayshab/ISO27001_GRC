# Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) Overview

## What is GRC?
GRC stands for Governance, Risk, and Compliance. It is a strategic framework that helps organizations align their objectives with risk management and regulatory requirements. GRC integrates the processes and information needed to ensure that an organization acts ethically, manages risks effectively, and meets all relevant legal and regulatory obligations.

## Key Components of GRC

### 1. Governance
- **Definition:** The system by which organizations are directed and controlled.
- **Focus:** Establishing policies, procedures, and decision-making structures to achieve organizational objectives and ensure accountability.
- **Examples:** Board oversight, management structures, policy frameworks.

### 2. Risk Management
- **Definition:** The process of identifying, assessing, and mitigating risks that could impact the achievement of objectives.
- **Focus:** Proactively managing threats and opportunities to protect value and support decision-making.
- **Examples:** Risk assessments, risk registers, incident response planning.

### 3. Compliance
- **Definition:** Adhering to laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies.
- **Focus:** Ensuring the organization meets its legal and regulatory obligations, as well as internal standards.
- **Examples:** Regulatory reporting, internal audits, policy enforcement.

## GRC and ISO 27001

ISO/IEC 27001:2022 is an international standard for information security management systems (ISMS). Implementing ISO 27001 is a key part of an organization's GRC strategy, particularly in the area of information security.

- **Governance:** ISO 27001 requires clear leadership, defined roles, and documented policies for information security.
- **Risk Management:** The standard mandates a risk-based approach to information security, including risk assessment, treatment, and ongoing monitoring.
- **Compliance:** ISO 27001 helps organizations meet regulatory and contractual requirements related to information security, privacy, and data protection.
